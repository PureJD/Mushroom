# Mushroom
This is a simple Text adventure game created in Python.
The idea behind this repository is to practice Git and Github, pulling the code from Github between computers and to push it back up.
I also wish to demonstate my ability to program in Python. I image the game will be badly programmed however, this is the intention. I have programmed the entire
game using intuition and not researching the best practice; This way it allows me to return to my method of programming and update the source code.
